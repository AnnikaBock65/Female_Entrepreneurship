# Female Entrepreneurship

## Overview

“Today, women have just three-quarters of the legal rights of men. In 1970, it was less than half.”[https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/how-have-womens-legal-rights-evolved-over-last-50-years] This was a statement by Tea Trumbic for the world bank in 2020. While women legal rights have been improved worldwide over the past 50 years, the goal of my Capstone project was to analyze this progress based on this following dataset: 

```
• https://wbl.worldbank.org/en/wbl-data [‘Women, Business and the Law Data for 1971-2021’] 
```

in comparison to the development over time of the economic situation of women worldwide based on the following datasets:

```
• https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/doingbusiness ['Historical data - with scores (Excel)']

• https://databank.worldbank.org/source/gender-statistics

• https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/data/exploretopics/entrepreneurship/gender ['gender disaggregated data on entrepreneurship from 2014-2018 (Excel)']
```

Since these datasets are very broad, this Capstone project will be focused on “Entrepreneurship”. 

## Motivation

Inspired by my volunteer work for the program “Dress for Success” of the local YWCA Nashville with the mission to empower women to achieve economic independence, the legal gender equality and economic independence of women are the central themes of my capstone project. As part of economic independence of women this capstone project analyzes the subject area “Female Entrepreneurship” in the economic and legal context.


## Data Question

“Is the Future of Entrepreneurship Female?”
