# capstone

Executive Summary
This section provides an overview to the project. It should briefly touch on the motivation, data question, data to be used, along with any known assumptions and challenges. 
“Today, women have just three-quarters of the legal rights of men. In 1970, it was less than half.”[https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/how-have-womens-legal-rights-evolved-over-last-50-years] This was a statement by Tea Trumbic for the world bank in 2020. While women legal rights has been improved worldwide over the past 50 years, the goal of my Capstone project is to analyze this progress based on this following dataset: https://wbl.worldbank.org/en/wbl-data [‘Women, Business and the Law Data for 1971-2021’] in comparison to the development over time of the economic situation of women worldwide based on the following dataset: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators[‘World Development Indicators’]. Since both datasets are very broad, this Capstone project will be focused on certain subject areas as for example “Entrepreneurship”. 
Motivation
Here you will go into more detail about why you have chosen this project. 
Inspired by my volunteer work for the program “Dress for Success” of the local YWCA Nashville with the mission to empower women to achieve economic independence, the legal gender equality and economic independence of women are going to be the central themes of my capstone project. As part of economic independence of women this capstone project will analyze the subject area “Entrepreneurship” in the economic and legal context.
Data Question

Present your question. Feel free to include any research/articles that are relevant or show where others have attempted to answer this question.

https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/women-entrepreneurs-needed-stat
https://wbl.worldbank.org/en/data/exploretopics/wbl_rb

Based on these two datasets I will research on “Female Entrepreneurs in the economic and legal context”.

“Is the Future of Entrepreneurship/Business Female?”


Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Define your MVP. This should be a description of what your final capstone will look like, including visualizations, how the analysis will be presented, who the intended audience is, etc.

The MVP will be an interactive dashboard: a color coded (yes=1, no=0) time-lapse world map of 50 years of women legal rights focused on the subject area “Entrepreneurship” in Tableau or Power Bi and a bar plot/histogram/scatterplot which shows economic values of female entrepreneurship worldwide as “Cost of business start-up procedures” per country for example. The intended audience would be anybody who’s interested in women legal rights in an economic context as well as non-profit organizations, government institutions etc. in particular.
