# Female Entrepreneurship

## Overview

“Today, women have just three-quarters of the legal rights of men. In 1970, it was less than half.”[https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/how-have-womens-legal-rights-evolved-over-last-50-years] This was a statement by Tea Trumbic for the world bank in 2020. While women legal rights have been improved worldwide over the past 50 years, the goal of my Capstone project was to analyze this progress based on this following dataset: 

```
• https://wbl.worldbank.org/en/wbl-data [‘Women, Business and the Law Data for 1971-2021’] 
```

in comparison to the development over time of the economic situation of women worldwide based on the following datasets:

```
• https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/doingbusiness ['Historical data - with scores (Excel)']

• https://databank.worldbank.org/source/gender-statistics

• https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/data/exploretopics/entrepreneurship/gender ['gender disaggregated data on entrepreneurship from 2014-2018 (Excel)']
```

Since these datasets are very broad, this Capstone project will be focused on “Entrepreneurship”. 

## Motivation

Inspired by my volunteer work for the program “Dress for Success” of the local YWCA Nashville with the mission to empower women to achieve economic independence, the legal gender equality and economic independence of women are the central themes of my capstone project. The key to economic independence of women is female entrepreneurship and the legal context that facilitates it which is what this capstone project will focus on.


## Data Question

“Is the Future of Entrepreneurship Female?”

## Analysis

• Analysis of the development of women's rights worldwide from 1972 - 2021 over time based on 4 questions (Yes = 1, No = 0)

```
"Does the law prohibit discrimination in access to credit based on gender?"
"Can a woman open a bank account in the same way as a man?"        
"Can a woman register a business in the same way as a man?"

```
